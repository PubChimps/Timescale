## Unchecked Growth - An introduction to serverless databases

The growth of cloud computing has been comprised of many, separate trends. A set of relatively new cloud services have formed via the intersection of two such trends: cloud databases and serverless computing. [Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2019-07-01-gartner-says-the-future-of-the-database-market-is-the) has said that in two years, 3 out of every 4 databases will run on a cloud. Flexera's State of the Cloud ranked severless computing as the fastest growing cloud service in [2018](https://www.suse.com/media/report/rightscale_2018_state_of_the_cloud_report.pdf) and the fourth highest in [2020](https://info.flexera.com/SLO-CM-REPORT-State-of-the-Cloud-2020), already being more widely used than popular workloads such as IoT and Machine Learning. Together, these concepts make up the world of serverless databases, this article will introduce both serverless computing and serverless databasing concepts, and let you know how you can get started with your own instance!

Primary goal was to, as mentioned, demonstrate the ability to explain a difficult concept related to databases in an entertaining manner. I tasked myself with a number of additional goals as well. First, avoid writing about ml -> cloud. serverless or mutlicloud. time and length constraints. like timescale articles.

### Serverless Computing

dynamic *The rise of serverless infrastructure hugely simplified the process of deploying code into production scaling, capacity planning or maintenance.* Functions on major csp. [Here](https://blog.timescale.com/blog/using-aws-lambda-with-timescale-cloud-for-iot-data/) is an example of how Amazon's serverless offering, AWS Lambda, can be used with TimescaleDB to ingest
and store IoT data.
